    Hi! I am Monika!!!
     I believe in "Time never remains the same".
     I am Electronics and Communication Engineer.
     Currently I am working with Navgurukul Foundation for Social Welfare.
     My aim is to bring some kind of change in the lives of people around me with the existing knowledge that I have and inculcate positivity in my surroundings.
     I have worked with CLI apps.

     Hobbies:-
     My hobbies include listening music, reading books or autobiographies of famous people like Swami Vivekananda, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. I also do pet keeping and look for ways to do something about the abandoned pets.
